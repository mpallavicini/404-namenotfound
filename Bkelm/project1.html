        <p class ="name">My name is Brandon Kelm, I will be graduating from Florida Atlantic University in the summer of 2017 with a degree in computer science.  The things that I love to do in my spare time consist of dabbling in electronics and computers, working on cars, and going freshwater fishing.  I have always been the type of kid that loves to take everything apart just to see how it all works, although I never really had time to put it all back together!  I used to use all the spare parts that came off and somehow connect them together to make something that did different things</p>
